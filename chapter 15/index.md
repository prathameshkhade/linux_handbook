# Chapter 15: Advanced Security Practices**  

## **1. Intrusion Detection and Prevention**  
   - **Understanding Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**  
     - Difference between IDS and IPS  
     - Host-based vs. Network-based IDS  
   - **Implementing `fail2ban` for Brute-force Protection**  
     - Installing and configuring `fail2ban`  
     - Creating and modifying jail configurations  
     - Monitoring logs and handling banned IPs  
   - **Monitoring for Suspicious Activity**  
     - Using `auditd` for system auditing  
     - Monitoring system logs (`/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`)  
     - Using `psad` for detecting port scans  
     - Real-time monitoring tools (`OSSEC`, `Suricata`, `Snort`)  

## **2. Data Encryption and Backup Security**  
   - **Importance of Encryption and Secure Backups**  
     - Why encryption matters for data security  
     - Encryption at rest vs. encryption in transit  
   - **Using `gpg` for File and Email Encryption**  
     - Generating GPG keys  
     - Encrypting and decrypting files  
     - Using GPG for secure email communication  
   - **Encrypting Disk and Partitions**  
     - Using LUKS for full disk encryption  
     - Configuring encrypted `/home` and swap partitions  
   - **Secure Backup Practices**  
     - Best practices for backup encryption  
     - Secure remote backups using `rsync` and `ssh`  
     - Automating encrypted backups with `duplicity`  

## **3. Mandatory Access Control (SELinux & AppArmor)**  
   - **Understanding Mandatory Access Control (MAC) vs. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**  
     - Difference between SELinux, AppArmor, and traditional Linux permissions  
   - **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) - Red Hat Based Systems**  
     - SELinux modes: Enforcing, Permissive, Disabled  
     - Understanding SELinux contexts and labels  
     - Managing SELinux policies using `semanage`, `setsebool`, `audit2allow`  
     - Troubleshooting SELinux denials (`ausearch`, `sealert`)  
   - **AppArmor - Ubuntu and Debian-Based Systems**  
     - Enabling and managing AppArmor profiles  
     - Creating custom AppArmor policies  
     - Debugging AppArmor violations (`aa-status`, `journalctl`)  

## **4. Secure SSH Configuration and Hardening**  
   - **Disabling Root Login and Using Key-based Authentication**  
   - **Restricting SSH Access with Allow/Deny Rules**  
   - **Implementing Two-Factor Authentication for SSH**  
   - **Configuring SSH Chroot Jails for Restricted Access**  

## **5. Kernel Hardening and Security Enhancements**  
   - **Applying Kernel Security Updates Regularly**  
   - **Using `sysctl` for System Hardening (`/etc/sysctl.conf`)**  
   - **Enabling Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**  
   - **Securing `/tmp`, `/var`, and `/home` with Mount Options**  

## **6. Network Security and Firewall Management**  
   - **Configuring `iptables` and `nftables` for Packet Filtering**  
   - **Using `ufw` and `firewalld` for Simplified Firewall Management**  
   - **Detecting and Preventing Port Scans (`nmap`, `fail2ban`)**  
   - **Mitigating DDoS Attacks using Rate Limiting**  

## **7. Security Auditing and Compliance**  
   - **Using `Lynis` for Linux Security Auditing**  
   - **Automating Security Compliance Checks**  
   - **Implementing a Logging and Alerting System (`logwatch`, `rsyslog`)**
